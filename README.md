The RayleighChannel function in the code is likely simulating the effect of a Rayleigh fading channel on the transmitted OFDM symbols.

In wireless communication, Rayleigh fading is a statistical model for the effect of a propagation environment on a radio signal, such as that used by wireless devices. It models the rapid amplitude changes that can be caused by objects in the environment, movement of the transmitter/receiver, or both.

The function takes the OFDM symbols
